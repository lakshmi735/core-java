1]public static void main(String ags[])

public--->access modifier
static--->keyword
void----->return type
main---->methodName
String ags[]---->Array of string type


it is a main and first method in java,without main method we can not execute any program in java.

2.class:
	class is a templete or blueprint in java.in java everything associated with class.
       syntax:
		class className{
				}
object:
	object is instance of the class.
	object perpose is to create multiple copy of the class.
	oject is real time.
	object consists of identity,state and behaviour
	object is creted using new keyword.
syntax:
	ClassName referenceVariable=new ClassName();
	

3.Jvm:
	java virtual machine
	it take the byte code and execute it in many platform
	it perform some task
		1.load the byte code
		2.verify the byte code.
		3.execute the bye code.
	many task of javm is provide a run time environment to execute byte code.
	jvm alone can not perform any task it take the help of jre and set of libraries.
	jvm is platform independent
JRE:
	Java Run Time Engine
	jre contain jvm and set of libraries
	jre is minimum require to excecute java program
	jre provide environment to only excecute java programs on machine.
	jre is platform dependent 
Jdk:
	jdk contains jre and java development tools like complier,docs,debbuger and other tools which required to java development.
	jdk is a platfrom dependent
	jdk provide environment to run and execute java program on machine.

4]Constructor
		constructor is special type of method it have the same name as class name without return type.
		there 2 type of constructor
		sytax:
			ClassName referenceVariable=new ClassName();
	here ClassName with paranthesis is called constructor

			1.default constructor
			2.parameter constructor
  	1.default constructor:constructor which have no parameter
                       public ClassName()
		{
		   //code
			}

	2.parameterized constructor: constructor which have parameter inside the paranthesis
			public ClassName(parameters or dataType variableName)
			{
			   //code
				}
9]Class Loader:
		class loader which is available in said the JVM in runtime in the program execution process
		class loader loades the bytecode into the JVM.that byte code is available compile time

5]This Keyword:
		this keyword is used to eliminate the confusion between the instace variable and parameter
                        ex: this.manager[i++]=manager;
                          left side manger is a variable of instance class
	          right side manager is a parameter of the method.
7]Method types:	
		method is block of code or set of statement which  perform some certain functionality

		there are 2 types of method availables in java
		1.pre-defined method
		2.user-defined method
 
		1.pre-defined method:->this method are defined by java this are already available in java program 
		

		2.user-defined method:->this methods are defined by user while writting a program 
12] we can not use instance variable inside the static method bcz instance variables are accessed by creating object and static is accessed by class name

public class LengthOfArray {
	
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int num[]={12,3,2,45,6,7,6};
		System.out.println(num.length);
	}
	
	

}

3]	public static void main(String a[])
	{
		String name="program";
		char c[]=name.toCharArray();
		for(int i=c.length-1;i>=0;i--)
		{
			
		System.out.println(c[i]);
		}
		
	}
